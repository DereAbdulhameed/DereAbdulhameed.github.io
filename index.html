				<h2> Medical Student turned Artificial Intelligence Enthusiast
				</h2>
				<p>Since my journey started about 3 years ago in Artificial Intelligence, I have become so addicted to
					the possibilities of AI improving healthcare. I have because of that worked on some health related projects,
					I have also worked on non-health related projects and I love teaching. Have fun while going through them!

						<p>In this project, mental health data of medical students was collected and analysed using a machine learning approach.
							This project did not only find out the factors that are more likely to oredispose to mental illness, it also
						 will predict whether or not,a student will be prone to mental illness during the medical training</p>

							<h2>IF ALL THE CLINICAL RISK FACTORS OF HEART DISEASE ARE PRESENT, DOES THAT NECESSARILY MEANS A PERSON SHOULD HAVE THE HEART DISEASE?</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Heart Diseases come with various forms of characteristics from chest pain, tightness, shortness of breath,
						palpitation amongst others. So if these features a present, either some or all of these risk factors, will that
						person automatically have a heart condition? This project uses machine learning to predict and make correlations
						between these risk factors.</p>

							<p>Voicebots are becoming a norm these day with the likes of Siri, Alexa amongst others.

								<h3>An FAQ chatbot</h3>
							</header>
							<p>In the spirit of demystifying covid myth, I created a conversational chatbot using Google's Dialogflow
							which discusses the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) as covid from Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) website
							This bot understand slight spelling mistakes and also does not need to take in the FAQ directly as they were written, even if modified,
							the chatbot still understands. I then integrated it with telegram</p>

								<h3>Credit Card Approval</h3>
							</header>
							<p>It is becoming overwhelming for financial institutions to make a decision on whose loan to be approved or not,
							well, ML does a great job. In this project, I together with some other colleagues worked on a dataset from an institution,
							and we were able to produce a solution that can autonomously decide on approval based on the pattern of purchase
							by the customer.</p>
